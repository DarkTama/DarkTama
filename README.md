Hi, I’m @DarkTama
I’ve always interested in taking part in game development
I’m currently learning programming, way from the basic

I graduated from Programmer Major Highschool, but then decided to steer my CAReer a turn
that was a grave and the worst mistake i ever did
I hope i can get back to this career i once dream to be.
